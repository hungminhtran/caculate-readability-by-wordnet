				<sent id ="17">I looked for it but in vain.</sent>
				<sent id ="18">The teacher asked all the students if they had found it.</sent>
				<sent id ="19">But they replied in the negative.</sent>
				<sent id ="20">So the teacher checked their bags.</sent>
				<sent id ="21">He found the pen in Monti's bag.</sent>
				<sent id ="22">But how could it be there in Monti's bag?</sent>
				<sent id ="23">One could easily guess that Monti took it without Meena's knowledge.</sent>
				<sent id ="24">To steal is a sin.</sent>

				<sent id ="38">He loves the sinners too.</sent>
				<sent id ="39">He wants the sinners to change their mind.</sent>
				<sent id ="40">So he visits the houses of sinners.</sent>
				<sent id ="41">Jesus becomes happy if a sinner changes his mind.</sent>
				<sent id ="42">The following story will tell us more clearly about it.</sent>
				<sent id ="43">Jesus says to Zacchaeus, Get down from the tree.</sent>
				<sent id ="44">I'll go to your house today.</sent>

				<sent id ="47">He did people much wrong.</sent>
				<sent id ="48">Since, he was a very favourite employee of the country's ruler.</sent>
				<sent id ="49">Nobody could say anything against him.</sent>
				<sent id ="50">The amount of taxes he collected from the people was more than what was due.</sent>
				<sent id ="51">The ruler of the country never told him anything for his dishonesty.</sent>
				<sent id ="52">Thus Zacchaeus gathered much wealth and became rich.</sent>
				<sent id ="53">He did it out of greed and had no peace of mind.</sent>
				<sent id ="54">So he thought that he would confess his sins to Jesus.</sent>
				<sent id ="55">But he did not find an opportunity to do so.</sent>
				<sent id ="56">One day Jesus was going to the town of Jericho.</sent>
				<sent id ="57">His disciples were also with him.</sent>
				<sent id ="58">Many people started following him.</sent>

				<sent id ="60">But he was short in size and could not see Jesus because of the crowd.</sent>
				<sent id ="61">I will go to your house today.</sent>
				<sent id ="62">Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed him with great joy.</sent>
				<sent id ="63">Jesus and his disciples went to Zacchaeus house.</sent>
				<sent id ="64">Zacchaeus committed much sins and thought that Jesus would never go to his house.</sent>
				<sent id ="65">But now he was very happy to see Jesus in his house.</sent>
				<sent id ="66">A great change came over him.</sent>
				<sent id ="67">He put his faith in Jesus.</sent>
				<sent id ="68">He promised not to commit sins any more.</sent>
				<sent id ="69">They spoke ill of Jesus.</sent>
				<sent id ="70">Zacchaeus said Lord, please listen sir!</sent>
				<sent id ="71">Jesus said to him, Salvation has come to this house today.</sent>
				<sent id ="72">He further said, I've come to the world to seek and save the lost.</sent>
				<sent id ="73">How nice the story is!</sent>
				<sent id ="74">It tells us how kind Jesus is.</sent>
				<sent id ="75">It also tells us that Jesus goes to the house of sinners as well.</sent>
				<sent id ="76">Because he wants to change sinner's mind.</sent>
				<sent id ="77">Jesus forgives them who change their mind.</sent>
				<sent id ="78">Jesus will forgive us only when we promise not to commit sins any more.</sent>
				<sent id ="79">The story of Zacchaeus teaches us that Jesus loves all human being.</sent>
				<sent id ="80">He loves the sinners in particular.</sent>
				<sent id ="81">He never hates them.</sent>
				<sent id ="82">He wants to correct the sinners through his love.</sent>
				<sent id ="83">He came to the world for the salvation of mankind.</sent>
				<sent id ="84">We have also committed sins.</sent>
				<sent id ="85">Jesus will forgive our sins and bless us.</sent>
				<sent id ="86">Like Zacchaeus we must confess our sins to Jesus and correct ourselves.</sent>
				<sent id ="87">Draw a picture showing Zacchaeus on the top of a tree and Jesus under it.</sent>
