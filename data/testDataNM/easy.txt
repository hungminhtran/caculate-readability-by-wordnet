Scientist say that your tongue can recognize only four tastes. It can tell if something is sour
( like vinegar) or bitter ( like soap). But that’s all. To tell different foods apart, we also have to
use our noses.
Can you remember a time when you had a bad cold? Your food tasted very plain then. It
seemed to have little taste at all. That wasn’t because your tongue wasn’t working. It was
because your nose was stopped up. You couldn’t smell the food, and that made it seem
tasteless. You can prove this to yourself. Try eating something while you pinch your nose
shut. It won’t seem to have much taste.
Here’s another test. It shows how important the nose is in tasting. First you blindfold a
person. Then you put a piece of potato in his mouth. You tell him to chew it. At the same time,
you hold a piece of apple under his nose. Then ask what food is in his mouth. Most people
will say, “ An apple.” The smell of the apple fools them. The test works best when two foods
feel the same in the mouth. It won’t work well with apple and orange slices
